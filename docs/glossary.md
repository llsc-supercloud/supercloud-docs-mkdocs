Glossary
========

The following is a list of commonly used terms and acronyms, and their
definitions when used in the context of the MIT SuperCloud.

First is a visual labeling the portions of the system with the
terminology we tend to use for each piece.

![image1](images/ArchNomenclature.png)

**Accelerators**
A piece of hardware used to speed up computation, usually for a
  specific operation. GPUs are used as an accelerator for certain matrix
  operations.

**Bandwidth**
A theoretical measure of how much data could be transferred from
  source to destination in a given amount of time.

**Bash shell**
A specific shell and language used at the command line. This is the
  shell used on SuperCloud.

**Bash script/Shell script**
A script using bash command syntax.

**Batch job**
A job for running a pre-written script or executable. Resources are
  requested through the scheduler, the schedule allocates the resources
  when they are available, runs the script, and then exits.

**Cluster**
Many nodes connected via a fast network interconnect.

**Command Line**
A text-based user interface that allows a user to type commands that
  the computer then executes.

**Compute Nodes**
Nodes where the computation is done on the system (where you will run
  your code). Compute nodes are managed by the scheduler.

**Core**
A core is the smallest computation unit that can run a program.

**CPU**
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of a computer which
  executes software programs. CPU refers to an individual silicon chip,
  such as Intel's Xeon-E5 or AMD's Opteron.  A CPU contains one or
  more cores.  Also known as a processor or socket.

**Data Server**
Also called an Object Storage Server. A component of a parallel file
  system which stores all of the data of the files on the file system.

**(Job) Dependency**
Defer the start of a job until the specified dependencies have been
  satisfied completed. This is usually the completion of another job.

**Distributed Memory (see "Memory Models")**
In a distributed memory system, each CPU has its own private memory.
  Processes can only operate on local data. If remote data is required,
  the process must communicate with the remote process over an
  interconnect.

**Downtime**
A regular maintenance day during which the system is unavailable.

**Environment Variable**
Environment variables allow you to customize the environment in which
  programs run. They become part of the environment in which the
  programs run and can be queried by running programs. For example, you
  can set an environment variable to contain the path to your data
  files. Your running process can query this environment variable to get
  the location of the files.

**File Permissions**
Properties of a file that determine who can read, write, or execute
  (run) a file.

**Filesystem**
The system that controls how and where data is stored on storage disk.
  See Shared/Central Filesystem and Local Filesystem.

**GPU**
A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a specialized device originally
  used to generate computer output.  Each compute node can host one or
  more GPUs.  Modern GPUs have many simple compute cores and have been
  used for parallel processing.

**Group Shared Directory**
A directory, created upon user request, where members of the group
  shared directory can share files with other members of the group.
   Since a user's home directory is accessible only to the user, a group
  shared directory is the only mechanism for users to share files.

**GUI**
Graphical User Interface- these are interfaces that allow the user to
  interact with a program with a mouse through visual icons, as opposed
  to a command line interface.

**Home Directory**
Where the user keeps their files. Each user has their own home
  directory.

**HPC**
High Performance Computing (HPC) refers to the practice of aggregating
  computing power to achieve higher performance that would not possible
  by using a typical computer.  The community often used **concurrent
  computing** to mean programs running at the same time v in serial one
  after another.

**Hub**
A networking component that takes an incoming message and broadcasts
  it across all of the other ports of the hub.

**Independent (Tasks/Processes)**
Tasks/processes that can operate by themselves without needing data
  from another.

**Interactive Job**
An interactive job allows you to actually log in to a compute node.
  This is useful for when you need to compile software, test jobs and
  scripts, or run software that requires keyboard inputs and user
  interaction, such as a graphical interface .

**Interconnects**
The connections between components of the computer (this interconnect
  is called the System Network), and the computer to the Internet
  network (this interconnect is called the Network Connection).

**I/O (Input/Output)**
Refers operations that involve a transfer of data, particularly
  reading from and writing to the filesystem.

**Job**
A job is a separately executable unit of work whose resources are
  allocated and shared.  Users create job submission scripts to ask the
  scheduler for resources (cores, a specific processor type, etc).  The
  scheduler places the requests in a queue and allocates the requested
  resources.

**Job Array**
According to the Slurm documentation:  "Job arrays offer a mechanism
  for submitting and managing collections of similar jobs quickly and
  easily".   Job arrays are useful for applying the same processing
  routine to a collection of multiple inputs, data, or files.  Job
  arrays offer a very simple way to submit a large number of independent
  or **High Throughput** processing jobs.

**Job Slot**
A computational resource unit that is roughly equivalent to a
  processor core. One or more job slots can be used to execute a
  process.

**Jupyter Notebook**
An interactive browser-based programming environment.

**Latency**
The delay before a transfer of data begins following an instruction
  for its transfer.

**Lgpn**
Average observed Load per GPU on the node.

**LLGrid Beta**
LLGrid Beta is a collection of software packages that are released as
  a beta test on the SuperCloud.  The beta software packages are ones
  that SuperCloud users have requested but are not included in the
  SuperCloud system image.

**LLMapReduce**
A language-agnostic command for running loosely coupled or MapReduce
  applications.

**LLx**
A course platform containing online courses that use the SuperCloud
  system for exercises.

**Lnode**
Average observed Load on the node.

**Local Filesystem**
Each node in the cluster has its own local filesystem that is only
  accessible from that node. The system image and software stack is on
  the local filesystem. It also contains space that can be used during
  jobs for fast file access.

**Login Node**
The login node controls user access to a parallel computer.  Users
  usually connect to login nodes via SSH to compile and debug their
  code, review their results, do some simple tests, and submit their
  interactive and batch jobs to the scheduler.

**Loosely Coupled**
Applications that involve an independent (map) step where the same
  operation can be performed by many processes on different inputs,
  followed by a serial step that uses the output of the first step as
  its input. Also called MapReduce.

**Lppn**
Average observed Load per process on the node.

**Man page**
Short for "manual page". Documentation for a command or program.

**MapReduce**
See "Loosely Coupled".

**Mbpc**

**Metadata Server**
A component of a parallel file system which maintains the state of all
  files and folders within the file system, and the list of data servers
  where it can find the data for the files.

**MIMO Mode**
Multiple input, multiple output is an application mode for use with
  LLMapReduce. In MIMO mode your application iterates through multiple
  inputs. LLMapReduce calls and loads your application once in order to
  process multiple assigned inputs.

**Modules**
Here we are referring to "environment modules", but we often refer
  to them just as "modules". An open source software management tool
  used in most HPC facilities.  Using modules enable users to
  selectively pick the software that they want and add them to their
  environment.  Using the module command, you can manipulate your
  environment to gain access to new software or different versions of a
  package.

**MPI**
The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library for passing messages
  between processes and between compute nodes within a parallel job
  running on a cluster. There are a variety of open source and
  commercial versions of MPI that have been developed over the past
  several decades including mpich,  OpenMPI, and Intel MPI.

**Multi-Threaded**
Describes an application that uses multiple threads. See "Shared
  Memory". 

**Ncpn**
Number of hardware Cores Per Node.

**Ngpn**
Number of hardware GPUs Per Node.

**Nnode**
Number of Nodes.

**Node**
A stand-alone computer where jobs are run.  Each node is connected to
  other compute nodes via a fast network interconnect.  While accessible
  via interactive jobs, compute nodes are not meant to be accessed
  directly by users.

**Non-Volatile Memory**
Storage device where the information stored on it remains intact even
  when the computer is shut down or restarted, e.g., disk drives.

**Np**
Number of Processes = Nnode * Nppn.

**Nppn**
Number of Processes Per Node.

**Ntpn**
Number of Threads Per Node = Nppn * Ntpp.

**Operating System (OS)**
The software that manages how each of the applications running on the
  computer interact with the hardware of the computer to accomplish
  tasks.

**Path**
A list of directories separated by "/" characters that shows the
  location of a file or directory in the directory structure.

**Absolute Path**
The full path from the root of the filesystem, /. For example, the
  absolute path to the home directory for studentx would be:
  /home/gridsan/studentx.

**Relative Path**
The path to a file or directory from the current location.

**Process**
An independent computation running on a computer.  Processes have
  their own address space and may create threads that will share their
  address space.  Processes must use interprocess communication to
  communicate with other processes.

**Router**
A networking component that acts as a special switch that moves
  messages across defined network boundaries.

**Rsync**
A command for transferring and syncing files between systems.

**Scheduler**
The scheduler receives job and task execution requests from users and
  manages how and where they are executed across the many compute nodes
  in the HPC system. Before starting a job, it ensures that the needed
  resources are available for the job. The scheduler monitors running
  jobs, can stop jobs, and can provide information about completed jobs
  and the status of the system (e.g. what resources are currently
  available).

**Shared/Central Filesystem**
The shared filesystem is the filesystem that is available to all nodes
  in the cluster. Home and group directories are on the shared
  filesystem.

**Shared Memory (see "Memory Models")**
In a shared memory system, there is shared memory that can be
  simultaneously accessed by multiple CPUs in a multiprocessor CPU.
  Communication or data passing among threads or processes in a shared
  memory system is via memory.

**Shell**
Another term for the Linux command line interface.

**SISO Mode**
Single input, single output is an application mode for use
  with LLMapReduce. In SISO mode, your application runs on a single
  input. LLMapReduce calls and loads your application once in order to
  process one assigned input.

**Slurm**
Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) is a job
  scheduler which coordinates the running of many programs on a shared
  facility.  Slurm is used on the MIT SuperCloud system.  It replaced
  the SGE scheduler.

**Socket**
A computational unit packaged as one, and usually made of a single
  chip often called processor.  Modern sockets carry many cores.

**SPMD**
Single Program Multiple Data

**SSH**
Secure Shell (SSH) is a protocol to securely access remote computers.
   Based on the client-server model, users with an SSH client can access
  a remote computer.  Some operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS
  have a built-in SSH client and others can use one of many publicly
  available clients.  For Windows, we recommend PuTTY or Cygwin for ssh.

**SSH Keys**
Credentials used as an authentication method for ssh. These come in
  pairs: a public and private key. Public keys are placed on the system
  you need to access, private keys are placed on your computer. When you
  ssh in the ssh program checks to see whether the public key fits your
  private key.

**Submission/batch script**
A script for submitting a batch job to the scheduler. It is a bash
  script that tells the scheduler how to run your job, and may include
  the resources you are requesting for you job.

**Switch**
A networking component that is more efficient than a hub. It takes an
  incoming network message and sends it out only onto the switch port on
  which its destination will be reached. Switches only transmit messages
  within a defined network.

**Symlink**
Short for symbolic link. A file that acts as a shortcut by pointing to
  another file or directory on the filesystem. If you are in a group you
  may see a symbolic link to the shared group directory in your home
  directory.

**Terminal (Window)**
A window containing a command line prompt.

**Third-party software**
According to Wikipedia: a third-party software component is a reusable
  software component developed to be either freely distributed or sold
  by an entity other than the original vendor of the development
  platform. 

Examples of third-party software on the SuperCloud system include MATLAB
and TensorFlow. 

**Thread**
Threads are lightweight processes which exist within a single
  operating system process.  Threads share the address space of the
  process that created them and can communicate directly with other
  threads in the same process.

**Throughput**
An actual measure of how much data is successfully transferred from
  source to destination in a given amount of time.

**Throughput (Workflow)**
A throughput application is one that is fully independent. Often this
  means it is running the same operation on a number of different inputs
  or parameters, and the result of an operation on one input does not
  depend on the result of another.

**Triples (Mode)**
A job submission mode that allows you to request resources in a
  triple: Number of Nodes, Number of Processes per Node, and Number of
  Threads per Process. Available for LLsub job arrays, LLMapReduce, and
  pMatlab jobs.

**Ubpn**
Average observed Used bytes per node.

**Ubpp**
Average observed Used bytes per process.

**Unix, Linux**
Unix is a family of portable, multi-tasking, multi-user operating
  systems. Linux is an open source, Unix-like operating system that is
  derived from Unix. The SuperCloud system runs the Ubuntu version of
  the Linux operating system.

**User space**
User space is a set of locations where normal user processes (i.e.
  everything other than the kernel, the lowest part of the operating
  system) run.

**Volatile Memory**
Storage device where applications and data are loaded so that the
  processors can actively work with them, e.g. RAM and cache. The
  information stored on it does not remain intact when the computer is
  shut down or restarted.

**Web Portal**
A web page for SuperCloud where you can access your SuperCloud
  account. On the Web Portal you can add ssh keys, access the files in
  your home directory, and start Jupyter Notebooks.
